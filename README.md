# OrchidCore

A (work in progress) Hytale mod for essential player & admin utilities, written by a real person and
not a LLM.

This mod is not yet stable, and is going to be renamed soon.

Currently, OrchidCore has the following implemented:

- tpask (ask to teleport to another player, who can then accept or deny)
  - tpaccept
  - tpdeny
- msg (Privately message other players)
- reply (Reply to last person who messaged you)
- Discord bridge 
  - Server startup and shutdown
  - Join and leaves
  - Messages from Hytale to Discord
  - Messages from Discord to Hytale

More is coming soon, including:

- Chat formatting
- Improved join server messages
- Per-user cusrom join messages
- User-equipable chat prefixes called tags
- Discord account linking
- Giving Discord roles to players based on permissions
- tpahere (Teleport another player to you)
- tpcancel (Cancel all outgoing teleportation requests)
- AFK system
- Waypoint system
  - Waypoints on the map and compass
  - Potentially visuals for when someone teleports to a warp
